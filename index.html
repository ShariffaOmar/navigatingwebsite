    <h1>Progressive structures inherited from colonial and western culture</h1> 
    <p>There are some of the progressive structure as a result of colonialsm and western culture.<br></p>
    <header>Education and literary skills</header>
    <p>The African cultures that had no written script, quickly learnt how to get them as a result of European educators. In many parts of Africa where a written language existed, it was previously for a small elite as it had been in Europe in the middle ages. Besides the profiteering colonists came there was also a mixture of religious leaders bent on doing good. Some of them did much for education in Africa. Morover schools were constructed and hence Africans started schooling and were explored to many things.Even there was publication of different books to facilitate learning.Its a progressive culture since till now schools exists.The education skills has helped many Africans to gain knowledge in different fields and also helps in running the government.</p>
    <header>Technology</header>
    <p> Mechanisation grew exponentially during the colonial period. Africa, in many places endowed with natural climates that supported human life without as much support as would be needed in, for example, Europe, developed slower in terms of technology. The advent of colonisation brought such technologies to Africa.There was invention of different machines that makes work easier.The invention of power to support the running of different tasks that require power.Roads were constructed to allow easy movement of goods from different parts of Africa. Until now roads are beaing constructed for easy transportation of goods.Invention of telephones that made communication easier.There was also invention of different means of transport that are safer and faster e.g ships, aeroplane,busses,motorcycles e.t.c</p>
    <h2>Western culture that are not of importance</h2>
    <header>Misuse of power</header>
    <p>Many Africans leaders  think that once they get the power they have the authority to do anything.Its like they are  exercising power over their subjects in a bad way.They think that they can do anything without being questioned hence they end up not serving their people in a correct way.Some of the political leaders use their power to involve themselves in bad activities like  mass just to gain more wealth<br>
    What should be done is that the leaders should realize why they were choosen to lead and also have a sense of humanity.
    </p>
    <header>Erosion of culture</header>
    <p>
      it hasminimized ethical and moral values. This resulted from adopting westerncultures and tradition. People tend to lose their own cultures and traditionand are evident in the way some people conduct themselves. For e4ample,news and reports of criminal activity will be on the news almost every day,this is because people want to imitate what they see in western movies.Consequently, culture and tradition is slowly fading away and ethical andmoral values are forgotten.
    </p>
    <header>What should be done about these negative effects of western culture</header>
    <p>Its time that Africans realise themselves as Africans and appreciate themselves.Its time we embrace our culture and shade the negative culture of the western side.</p>
